# Rotten-Tomato-Sentiment-Analysis
Text mining project from Kaggle


This project is a competition on Kaggle about sentiment analysis on rotten tomatoes movie reviews. The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, originally collected by Pang and Lee. In their work on sentiment treebanks, Socher et al. [2] used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to create fine-grained labels for all parsed phrases in the corpus.  
 
In this project, we are going to apply different machine learning technologies on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. Our objective is to classify opinions in a text review by labeling phrases on a scale of five values: negative (0), somewhat negative (1), neutral (2), somewhat positive (3), positive (4).
